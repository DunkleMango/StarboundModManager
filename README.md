# StarboundModManager
Allows to manage mods from the game Starbound easily! (works with Steam)

The StarboundModManager enables the user to manage their mods from the game [Starbound](http://playstarbound.com/).  

This application is in no way associated with Starbound and their creators Chucklefish!  
It was only created by [DunkleMango](https://github.com/DunkleMango) for the purpose of simplifying the process of managing mods for the game.  

## Setting up the application (v1.0)
Start by downloading the StarboundModManager.jar file or compile the code yourself.  
Next, run the jar file with Java.  

You should see a window that looks like this:  

![Application started](https://i.imgur.com/kCZEEzx.png)  

Now do not worry, if you don't see any files listed in the application.  
This just means that the default location where steam was expected to be, was not found or that you don't have any mods downloaded via steam yet.  

In case the steam directory was incorrect, you can select it by yourself.  
We want to select the Workshop directory, so please click on **[Choose input directory]**  

You will see, that a new windows has opened, please select the Steam-workshop directory with the path:  
**Steam\SteamApps\workshop\content\211820**  
The number **211820** corresponds to Starbound!

Once we finished selecting this directory and the window closes, we continue by pressing the button  
**[Choose output directory]**  

A new window opens. In this case, we want to select the mods folder of Starbound with the path:  
**Steam\SteamApps\common\Starbound\mods**

![Select Starbound mods path](https://i.imgur.com/bE7YoNe.png)  

Once you finished, you are ready to use the StarboundModManager!  
Don't worry about having to repeat this process. All changes will be automatically saved in your home directory in a small config file! :)
